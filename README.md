Cometutils
==========

An Astropy (http://astropy.org/) compatible package for working with cometary data.

So far, this package does nothing.  See the Wiki for some ideas and planning.  Contributions will be welcome once work begins in earnest (potentially second-half of 2017?).  Coordination with Asteroidpy (https://github.com/mommermi/asteroidpy) is mandatory.
